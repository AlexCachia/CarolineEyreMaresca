	<p>
		As a professional singer and also a qualified teacher, I am very fortunate to have a career doing both the things I love in equal quantities.
	</p>	
	<p>
		As a singer, I perform in venues ranging from the most intimate of restaurants to the largest theatres in Europe, using both my ability to front a show and my skills with harmony singing as a backing vocalist. I also perform for a range of events and functions such as weddings.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a qualified teacher, I am trained to teach singing and breathing techniques to both children and adults. I also offer a tuition service supporting children who are struggling with reading and writing.
	</p>
	<p>
		For both singing and teaching, most of my work is now mainly based around London and the South East but I am more than happy to travel further when required. Just indicate the location for the your function on my contact page.
