		When available space is limited or something more intimate is required for your wedding, civil ceremony or other special occasion, I can create a programme to suit your requirements.
	</p>
	<p>							
		I have a repertoire of songs ranging from the 1940s up to the present day, from the cool jazz sounds of Sinatra through to popular songs of the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s up to the more current artists like Amy Winehouse and Ellie Golding. I bring a fully self-contained professional sound system and top quality lighting to each show.
